WARNING: [SMARTCONNECT-2] Port S00_AXI of /axi_smc is connected to an infrastructure IP (/radio/receiver/s_axi_interconnect/m00_couplers/m00_data_fifo).  It is recommended to attach AXI SmartConnect directly to endpoint IPs to avoid mismatches or other issues during validation.  If mismatches occur, manually assign values for AXI Interface properties of /radio/receiver/s_axi_interconnect/m00_couplers/m00_data_fifo.
