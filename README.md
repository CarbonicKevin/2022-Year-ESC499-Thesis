## Quick Start
Follow the instructions below to install the Spectrum Analyser now. **You will need to give your board access to the internet**.
* Power on your RFSoC development board with an SD Card containing a fresh PYNQ v2.7 image.
* Navigate to Jupyter Labs by opening a browser (preferably Chrome) and connecting to `http://<board_ip_address>:9090/lab`.
* We need to open a terminal in Jupyter Lab. Firstly, open a launcher window as shown in the figure below:
